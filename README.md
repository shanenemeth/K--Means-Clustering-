# K--Means Clustering
 
* Analyzed an iris dataset to segment different flower types into distinct clusters based on their attributes 
* Scaled the dataset in preperation for the algorithm
* Utilized the "Elbow Method" to determine the optimal number of "K" or clusters for the model
* Used the K-Means function to create the clusters
* Visualized the clusters using factoextra package
